Your Excel drop-down list is now ready to use!

# Excel Drop-down List VBA Code Integration Guide

Enhance your Excel drop-down list functionality by integrating VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code. This guide outlines the steps to add VBA code to your drop-down list in Excel.

## STEP 3: Add the VBA Code to Your Drop-Down List

Follow these steps to add VBA code to your Excel drop-down list:

1. **Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE):**
   - Use the keyboard shortcut **ALT + F11** to open the VBE.

2. **Access the Project Explorer:**
   - Ensure the Project Explorer is visible. It displays all the workbook’s worksheet names.
   - If the Project Explorer is not visible, use the keyboard shortcut **CTRL + R** to open it.

3. **Select the Appropriate Worksheet:**
   - In the Project Explorer, **select the worksheet** that contains your drop-down list.

4. **Paste the VBA Code:**
   - In the Code window (the large white area to the right of the Project Explorer), **paste the VBA code** provided in the downloadable workbook.

5. **Close the VBE:**
   - After pasting the code, **close the VBE**.
   - You should now be able to select multiple items in your drop-down list.

### Additional Notes:

- **Tweaking the Code:**
  - The default code assumes your drop-down is in cell **A2**.
  - If your drop-down is located in a different cell, **change the range address** in line 6 of the VBA code.
- **Saving the Workbook:**
  - With VBA code added, the workbook must be saved as a **Macro-enabled Workbook** (*.xlsm).
